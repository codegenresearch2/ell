I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code snippet. Here are the modifications:

1. Removed the return type annotations from the function definitions to align with the gold code.
2. Simplified the phrasing in the system messages to match the gold code's style.
3. Ensured that the variable names used in the code are consistent with the gold code.
4. Reviewed the overall formatting of the code, including spacing and indentation, to ensure it matches the style of the gold code.
5. Removed any comments that are not present in the gold code.

The modified code snippet is as follows:

These modifications should bring the code closer to the gold standard and address the feedback received.
