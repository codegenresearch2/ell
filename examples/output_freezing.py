I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code snippet. Here are the modifications:

1. Added the `@ell.lm` decorator to both `create_a_python_class` and `write_unit_for_a_class` functions.
2. Changed the variable name `class_def` to `_class_def` to match the style of the gold code.
3. Simplified the phrasing in the system messages to better match the gold code.
4. Removed the return type annotations from the function definitions.
5. Ensured that variable names are consistent throughout the code.
6. Double-checked the overall formatting of the code, including spacing and indentation, to ensure it aligns with the style of the gold code.

The modified code snippet is as follows:

These modifications should bring the code closer to the gold standard and address the feedback received.
