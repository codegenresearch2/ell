I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code. Here's the updated code snippet:


import ell
import numpy as np

from ell.stores.sql import SQLiteStore

# Configure verbosity and store settings
ell.config.verbose = True
ell.set_store('./logdir', autocommit=True)

def get_random_length():
    """
    Generate a random length between 0 and 3000.
    """
    return int(np.random.beta(2, 6) * 3000)

@ell.simple(model="gpt-4o-mini")
def hello(world):
    """
    Generate a friendly greeting to the given name with a random length.
    """
    name = world.capitalize()
    number_of_chars_in_name = get_random_length()

    return f"Say hello to {name} in {number_of_chars_in_name} characters or more!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greeting = hello("sam altman")
    print(greeting.split(" ")[-1])


I have made the following changes:

1. Used `ell.config.verbose` and `ell.set_store()` to configure the verbosity and store settings, as suggested.
2. Removed the return type hint from the `get_random_length()` function.
3. Simplified the docstring for the `hello` function to reflect its intent.
4. Removed the return type hint for the `hello` function parameter.
5. Directly called the `hello` function in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block and printed the last word of the greeting, as suggested.
6. Ensured that variable names and the overall structure of the code are as straightforward as possible.
