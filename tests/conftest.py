    # Mock the OpenAI client
    with patch('openai.OpenAI') as MockOpenAI:
        # Create a mock client that returns None for chat.completions.create
        mock_client = MockOpenAI.return_value
        mock_client.chat.completions.create.return_value = None

        yield mock_client

    # Clean up after tests if necessary

I have addressed the feedback by setting the mock return value for `chat.completions.create` to `None` to match the gold code. I have also removed the unused import statement for `Mock`. The comments have been updated for clarity and conciseness. The cleanup comment is left as is, as no specific cleanup actions are needed in this context.
