In this revised code snippet:

1. **Mock Client Assignment**: The mock client is assigned to a variable (`mock_openai`) after patching, which aligns with the gold code's approach.

2. **Comment on Client Behavior**: The comment about configuring the mock client is updated to specify that it is set up to do nothing, which is more aligned with the gold code's intent.

3. **Cleanup Comment**: The comment about cleaning up after tests is kept to indicate the intention of the cleanup section.

This revised code should address the feedback received and align more closely with the gold code snippet's expectations.
