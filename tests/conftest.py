# Simplify client retrieval logic
# Assuming the client retrieval logic is in a function get_client()
def get_client():
    try:
        client = ...  # Retrieve client logic here
        if client is None:
            warnings.warn("No model client found. Please ensure the client is properly configured.")
        return client
    except Exception as e:
        warnings.warn(f"An error occurred while retrieving the model client: {str(e)}")
        return None

In this rewritten code, exceptions during test environment setup and client retrieval are handled more gracefully using try-except blocks. Clearer warnings are raised for missing model clients. The client retrieval logic is also simplified into a separate function for better organization and reusability.
