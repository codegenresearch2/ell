I have addressed the feedback by simplifying the comments for clarity and rearranging the imports to follow the standard convention. The comment about the mock client has been updated to indicate that it is configured to do nothing during testing. The cleanup comment is left as is, as it is good practice to indicate potential cleanup needs in the future.
