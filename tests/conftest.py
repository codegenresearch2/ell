In this revised code snippet, I have addressed the test case feedback by properly formatting the comments and removing the syntax error. I have also incorporated the oracle feedback by using `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the OpenAI client and yielding the mock client from the fixture. This allows for more controlled testing and avoids making real API calls. The `get_client()` function still needs to be implemented with the actual client retrieval logic.
