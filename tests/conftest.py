In the revised code, the OpenAI client is mocked using `unittest.mock.MagicMock`. This allows for the simulation of the OpenAI client's behavior during tests without making actual API calls. The mock client is then yielded from the fixture, allowing tests to use the mocked behavior directly. Unnecessary imports and error handling for client initialization have been removed to simplify the code. Additionally, the API key is not explicitly set in the fixture to ensure that tests do not rely on actual API keys or configurations.
