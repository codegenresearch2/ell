In this revised code snippet, I have addressed the test case feedback by properly formatting the comments and removing the syntax error. I have also incorporated the oracle feedback by adding comments to explain the purpose of each section, configuring the mock client to do nothing, patching the correct module, and including a placeholder for the client retrieval logic with a TODO comment.
