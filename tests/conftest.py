In this revised code snippet, I have addressed the test case feedback by properly formatting the comments and removing any extraneous comments that could be causing syntax errors. I have also incorporated the oracle feedback by setting a fake OpenAI API key, using the `mock_openai.return_value` to get the mock client, adding a comment about setting the API key, and including a placeholder for cleanup logic if needed.
