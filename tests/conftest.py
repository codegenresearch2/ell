    # Clean up after tests if necessary

In the updated code, I have removed the assertion checking for the model's existence in the registry as it is not present in the gold code. I have also added a mock OpenAI client and yielded it from the fixture, allowing tests to use the mocked client directly. The cleanup section is left empty as it is in the gold code.
