In this revised code snippet:

1. **Mock Client Assignment**: The mock client is assigned to a variable (`mock_openai_client`) after patching, which aligns with the gold code's approach and enhances clarity.

2. **Comment Clarity**: The comments are kept concise and directly reflect the actions being taken, ensuring clarity and avoiding syntax errors.

3. **Cleanup Comment**: The cleanup comment is kept succinct and directly indicates the intention of cleaning up after tests, similar to the gold code.

This revised code should address the feedback received and align more closely with the gold code snippet's expectations.
