    # Set a fake OpenAI API key for all tests
    os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-fake-api-key-for-testing'

    # Mock the OpenAI client
    with patch('openai.ChatCompletion.create') as mock_create:
        # Configure the mock client to return None
        mock_create.return_value = None

        # Yield the mock client for use in tests
        yield mock_create

    # Clean up after tests if necessary

In the updated code, I have addressed the syntax error by properly formatting the comments. I have also used `patch()` to mock the OpenAI client and set up the mock client to return `None` for the `chat.completions.create` method. The cleanup section is left with a comment indicating that cleanup may be necessary, even if no specific actions are implemented.
