In the revised code, the OpenAI client is mocked using `unittest.mock.patch`. This allows for the simulation of the OpenAI client's behavior during tests without making actual API calls. The mock client is then configured to return `None` for specific method calls to mimic the expected interactions with the OpenAI client. A comment is included to set a fake API key for testing, but it is commented out to ensure that tests do not rely on actual API keys. Finally, a comment is included to indicate that cleanup can be performed after tests if necessary.
