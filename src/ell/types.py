To address the feedback, I will update the `types.py` file to ensure it contains properly formatted Python syntax. Here's the revised content:"""This module defines the necessary types for the ell project."""from dataclasses import dataclassfrom typing import Any, Optional, Dict, List, Set, Union@dataclassclass Message:"    role: str"    content: Any"@dataclassclass InvocableLM:"    pass"# The above code defines the Message and InvocableLM classes using dataclasses for automatic method generation. The classes are simple placeholders and can be expanded with additional functionality as needed.
