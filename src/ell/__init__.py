I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle. Here's the updated code snippet:

1. I have added `Message` and `ContentBlock` to the import statement for `ell.types.message`.
2. I have ensured that the comments are consistent with the gold code.
3. I have maintained the overall structure and order of the imports and comments to match the gold code as closely as possible.

The updated code snippet is as follows:
