I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle. The test case feedback indicated that all tests passed, which is good. The oracle feedback suggested removing redundant string literals, checking for unused imports, ensuring consistent formatting, and streamlining comments.

Here's the updated code snippet:

I have removed the redundant string literals and ensured consistent formatting. I have also imported all models and everything from the configurator, as these are necessary for the code. I have removed any unused imports to keep the code clean and efficient.
