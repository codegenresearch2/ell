# In ell/types/studio.py
# Before:
# from ell.types import SerializedLMP

# After:
from ell.types.datamodels import SerializedLMP

# If SerializedLMP is defined in a different module, adjust the import statement accordingly.
# For example, if it's defined in ell/types/lmp.py:
# from ell.types.lmp import SerializedLMP

# Now, the SerializedLMP class should be accessible from the ell/types/studio.py module.
