# Assuming the issue is with the `ell.types` module, let's check the `__init__.py` file and ensure that `SerializedLMP` is being exported correctly.

# In ell/types/__init__.py
from .datamodels import SerializedLMP

# If SerializedLMP is defined in a different file, import it from there.
# For example, if it's defined in ell/types/lmp.py:
# from .lmp import SerializedLMP

# Now, the SerializedLMP class should be accessible from the `ell.types` module.
